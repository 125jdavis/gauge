# gauge

This project is an arduino-based instrument panel controller. It recieves inputs from GPS, analog, and CAN bus and outputs to 4x stepper motors for gauge pointers, LED warning lights, 2x OLED displays, and an LED tachometer. It is also able to send data via CAN to other microcontrollers on the bus.

The system is designed to be modular, intended to simplify retrofitting vintage instrument panels with modern internals.
