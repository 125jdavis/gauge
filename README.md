This project is an arduino-based instrument panel controller. It recieves inputs from GPS, analog, and hopefully soon CAN BUS and outputs to stepper motors, LED warning lights, and an OLED display.
This is a modular system which allows the user to retrofit vintage instrument panels with modern internals.
